Want to add the bot to your server? [Click here](https://placeholder/)! 

## Self-hosting

Make a new application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the bot with `$ python3 noni.py` on normal systems, or `$ py -3 noni.py` on Windows.

Paste your bot token in the client. If you choose to save, a **.env** will be generated and remembered on the next run.

While ignored by git, keeping your bot token in plaintext is always a risk. Please remember to **always keep your token private!**

You can also directly modify the `config.json` file.

```json
{
    "PREFIX": "/"
}
```

### Docker

In progress.
